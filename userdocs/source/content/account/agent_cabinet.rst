Agent cabinet
==================

In our affiliate network publishers can work with external ad targeting systems (VKontakte, MyTarget, Yandex.Direct).
 
Regular users can apply to various ad targeting systems and work with them independently. But in most cases these systems will reject the "non-native" links and redirects. Thus, if the publisher decides to publish the :ref:`affiliate links <partner-link>` in these a targeting systems, he or she will face the moderation problems or will be even banned.

To avoid refusing the redirects to the links of our affiliate program we concluded the agreements with several systems (VKontakte, MyTarget, Yandex.Direct) so that all accounts registered in our agency account could work inside such network. I.e. the external system trusts our affiliate program and all who we bring in. Technically this is implemented using the **Agent cabinet**. 

By now three **Agent cabinets** are available:

* VKontakte. The currency of this agency account is RUB.
* MyTarget. The currency of this agency account is USD.
* Yandex.Direct. The currency of this agency account is EUR.
