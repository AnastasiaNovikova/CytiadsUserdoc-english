An account in our system gives endless opportunities to users. It can be used to provide traffic to the best offers and work with many trusted partners. However its main purpose is to store the personal information and settings of the user

Users can manage their accounts in the first section of the interface, i.e. **Home**. To adjust or add information go to your **Personal account** in the **Home** section or just click your email in the top right corner.

Basically, we use ranking of publisher statuses to manage risks. As you know, we are positioned between a rock and a hard place: between advertisers and publishers. Advertisers need high-quality traffic and they are ready to pay for it, while publishers need multitude of various offers.

Publishers expect a wide range of offers they could work with. And we must satisfy both =)

To establish a comfortable environment for cooperation between advertisers and publishers we use ranking of statuses.

*************
Basic status
*************

A new publisher will receive the **Basic** status. It's the most important publisher for us. On the one hand, it's a partner who does not know us, and the partner whom we don't know too (he/she might be a fraudster?). On the other hand, such partner is our future development, and we just don't have a right to ignore him/her. That's why we put lots of efforts to make **Basic** publishers comfortable to work with us.

This group is offered the lightest traffic requirements, the main thing that we demand from this group is no frauding. But we also understand that this group has the highest risks, and we cant put the advertisers' money to risk, so we offer a limited set of offers to **Basic** publishers. Such an approach protects the interests of the advertiser and still allows **Basic** publishers to earn money.

***********
Advanced
***********

If a publisher provides lots of high-quality traffic and proved to our staff that he or she seeks an effective cooperation, then it will be our pleasure to offer more earning opportunities by upgrading the publisher's status to **Advanced**. This group has more privileges, can use more offers that are often more expensive than basic offers (while advanced publishers still have access to basic offers and they can continue working as before). However, there's the other side of the story. Traffic requirements for the **Advanced** publishers are higher, but the battle is worth the blood :).

***
VIP
***

The next level of trust to publishers is the **VIP** status. Only skilled professionals can get this status. Such publishers have much higher volumes of traffic compared to the previous groups, they are professionally involved in the Internet marketing and aim at high performance figures. We develop unique programs for such affiliates to satisfy both parties: advertisers and publishers. In most cases **VIP** partners will have a personal manager.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

So, publisher status is a parameter of the account that depends upon the traffic volume, quality and period of publisher cooperation with us. Publishers with higher statuses will get more profitable offers, but also we'll be more demanding to the traffic quality of publishers with higher statuses.
